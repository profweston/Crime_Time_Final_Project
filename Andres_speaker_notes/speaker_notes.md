# Slide 1

We chose supervised model 
•	Bc we already know what we are looking for (character of supervised modeling)

Looking to use model to determine if there was an arrest or not depending on the characteristic of the crime, location, and time.

Tried undersampling vs randomforest

RandomForest chosen bc:
•	Resistant to overfitting 
•	Good to run on large datasets
•	Resistant to outliers
